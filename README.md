## Roadmap

During this phase I underwent four stages in order to have a clear grasp and understanding of the project. Stage 1: Familiarizing myself with the company. Stage 2: Competitor Analysis Stage 3: Branding Analysis Stage 4: Ux Overall Questions. The final outcome of the process was a comprehensive and clear understanding of the company and the audience of the project. 

In this phase, I analyzed the entire design using a bird's-eye view in order to better understand the pattern of components as well as typography, colors, and other crucial information to gain a thorough view of the project prior to begin with the write code. In this phase, I gather all images, text, icons and other resources to help the project succeed. 

During this phase, I used modern, semantic and accessible HTML5 combined with Modern CSS, including flexbox and CSS Grid for layout. I also incorporated modern CSS practices for a 100% flexible layout. After that, I ensured that the website was completely responsive with a flexible approach that allowed me to cover a wide range of devices. I also used modern JavaScript to create dynamic effects like smooth scrolling for links, a sticky nav, and a beautiful mobile menu.
